The project for Text Classification Competition from the team "The West Coasters":

Tirthankar	Bhakta		tbhakta2@illinois.edu
Marina		Polupanova	marinap2@illinois.edu
Savita		Manghnani	savitam2@illinois.edu

We plan to classify tweets to predict the ones which can be qualified as sarcasm using following methods:
    • Random Forest
    • Logistic Regression
    • Support Vector Machine
    • Recurrent Neural Network
